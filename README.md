# About The Neuron Password Toolkit
Originally, this project was a small, C#-based, Windows Forms application that was included with my college senior thesis paper/survey. It was a valiant and completely overzealous academic project that attempted to cover the topic of password managers and ended up spilling into cryptography, open source software, and the idea of writing secure code. 

As I have grown as a developer, I decided to pick this project back up and give it new life. Bring it up to date, at first with WPF, and later with .NET MAUI (as the framework evolves and matures). Rearchitect and redesign for better flow within the project. Refactor existing pieces to make the code better (and to actually try and implement the idea of writing secure code). 

I'll update this as I make progress.
